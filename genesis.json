This is the 7th time we’ve interrupted your reading recently, but 98% of our readers don't give. Many think they’ll give later, but then forget. This Tuesday we ask you to protect Wikipedia.

The company has to decide whether they already have prospective customers within their customer base but using different services.[3]\n\nAfter defining the market, the product or service is researched until a final decision has been made on what the value proposition will be. Then the company determines its pricing strategy. It is very challenging to decide what pricing strategy to follow as it differs from one product or service to another, or even when the product or service remains the same but the strategy changes, such as switching to subscription-based pricing (an example for this is Adobe's major shift from selling its Creative Suite software which included all Adobe's products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, to a $50-per-month Creative Cloud and various other subscription plans).[4]\n\nMoreover, choosing the right distribution and marketing channels followed by promotion are very vital steps in a go-to-market strategy. A company has to decide which distribution model to choose, what kind of support and services are required and addressing the possibility of creating a competitive advantage.[5] Afterwards, the company decides how it is going to promote its product or services and what kind of marketing campaigns are the most influential to follow.[3]\n\nDriving factors in a go-to-market strategy\nWhen considering to develop a go-to-market strategy, there are 3 essential factors to focus on:[5]\n\nCustomers\nDelivering exceptional customer experiences leads to loyalty and advocacy of the customer. Consequently, that triggers increase in product purchase, customer retention and low cost of service.[6]\n\nThese are people that may or may not even know you exist, that you'd like to do business with. You have to figure out from a marketing standpoint, how to attract these people and get them to engage with your brand in some way such as visiting your website, attending a webinar, responding to an email and more.\n\nMQL The first conversion point is MQL which is a marketing qualified lead. This is a human being that has in some way expressed interest in engaging with you, it doesn't mean they're ready to buy but it means they are willing to engage. It could be a Contact Us form, it could be a demo request, it could be they just want to learn more, these can all be considered marketing qualified leads. The MQL is a qualification metric for the performance of your marketing.\n\nIf this rate grows over time, it means you are doing a better job at targeting your customer base, and a better job of converting them to be interested to engage. If you have 1000 people on your email list, and every month 10-30 of them become leads, you now can measure how good you are at engaging them via email.[7]\n\nCompany\nTaking company's mission and vision into account is a key determining factor when performing a go-to-market strategy. Motivating employees to perform well is a decisive factor to include. Thus, defining company's vision and what kind of impact it is trying to create is essential in the earliest stages of a go-to-market strategy.[8][9]\n\nCompetition\nUnderstanding the competition is crucial in deciding what product or service to offer. Gathering information about how competitors are performing in the market, what customers think of the different products available and what is missing in the market through conducting research using different methods such as SWOT and PEST analyses.[10]\n\nMarket Segmentation in a go-to-market strategy\nMarket segmentation is the process by which one divides prospective customers into different groups (segments) that have common needs and the same expected reaction to a marketing action. This approach enables companies to offer customers full value proposition of their products or services.[11]\n\n7 P's of Marketing\n7 Marketing P's. Used in targeting and defining a market in a go-to-market strategy.\nThere are common factors considered when performing a market segmentation in a go-to-market strategy:[12]\n\nIndustry: The industry in which the customer is involved.\nCustomer size and sales potential of the customer.\nCustomer behavior: Studying the customer's behavior related to the product or service such as the customer buying from a competitor or examining the responsiveness to selling effort.\nGeography: Geographical locations of prospective buyers.\nApplication and use of the product or service by the customer.\nBenefits earned by the customer due to buying the product or service.\nInformation which is required to be provided by the company to the customer.\nUsage situation: When and where the product or service is used.\nProfitability of selling to a certain customer.\nGo-to-market strategy and marketing strategy\nMarketing strategy includes every marketing activity which helps an organization to target the market after conducting market research.[13]\n\nGo-to-market strategy usually develops during the introduction of new products or services.[citation needed] Marketing strategy covers:[14]\n\nthe products or services of a business\nmarket share and position of those products and services\nidentification of clients and competitors\nbasics of a marketing plan\nExample of a go-to-market strategy\nAn example of using a go-to-market strategy could be observed in the automobile insurance industry. Initially, the company has to choose the right segment of the market (market segmentation). If the customers are considered individual households, then the company works on creating interest to their prospective customers using different forms of media such as TV advertisements, social media and billboards. Once the customers are persuaded to proceed, they are offered to purchase for the service through different channels such as the internet (company's website) or agents, both of which act as entities responsible for customer service.\n\nIn case of customers being corporate accounts during the market segmentation process, interest creation and purchase are done through direct sales, agents or the internet. Tele-service and direct service representatives serve as contacts after the purchase is done.[12]\n\nSee also\nMarketing\nMarket segmentation\nMarketing plan\nMarketing strategy\nReferences\n Friedman, Lawrence (2002).
